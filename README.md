# Lung Cancer Detection

This project focuses on the detection and analysis of lung cancer using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization to assist in early lung cancer detection.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing features to understand patterns.
- **Model Building:** Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization:** Displaying model results and insights with plots.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
