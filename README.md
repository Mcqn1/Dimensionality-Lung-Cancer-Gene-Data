## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to build classification models capable of identifying patterns in clinical data to detect lung cancer. It provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to data handling, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)** to reduce the number of features and improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing features to understand data distributions and patterns.
- **Model Building:** Training several machine learning classifiers.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of each model using key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix.
- **Visualization:** Displaying model results and insights with clear, informative plots.
